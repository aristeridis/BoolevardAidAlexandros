This app was made for my university theses

The current application is designed for the portable telephones
that use the Apple’s operating system, iOS.
The application gives the opportunity to the user to create an account anonymously or
eponymously and to be able to log-in in real time with the person that he is interested in, abiding
also by the basic privacy and personal data’s protection rules. The Google’s programme named
Firebase was used for this interaction, which give us the ability to create a user’s data basis such
as their encrypted messages, and which (programme) we connect with our project. After all, the
user has the ability to see with whom he has talked to and go back to his chat’s record.
